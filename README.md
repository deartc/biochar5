Biochar Star

Biochar Star is a webpage for a future business.  The webpage submitted in class is an educational webpage for biochar and the Biochar Star company but no items were listed as being sold due to time restrictions.  I will  transition it to a business webpage in the future that sells biochar and related items.  

CSS: 

I adjusted css for mobile and desktop usage.  On the main navigation I included a float and and bottom and top margins.  I added a navigation bar that adjust for mobile and desktop viewing. 

The classes I created are: header and footer sections.  I added padding and  background color changes for the header and footer section. The footer section was also provided for copyright data.  

Media queries were created to build the website mobile first so it could be viewed on mobile and desktop devices.
I also used media queries to adjust the naviagation menu bar for mobile and desktop viewing.    


Custom javaScript and other functions:
 I used javascript to adjust the navigation menu depending on whether a mobile device or desktop was used.  I used a slight variation of  a return functions instead of pure javascript to validate email. I used php so I could not only check email but validate it and send a message.   

Accessibility:  I followed best practices to ensure that the website was accessible for those users with slower internet connections. The html, css, and javascript was loaded in that order in order to allow for faster accesss.   I  personally designed my custom log "biochar star" to load faster.
